##### If you have more than 3 samples you can make a model. The model knows a bit more about the dataset b/c you provide all the data         at once. So you can do more comparisons to be made with statiscal signifiancy, for exampple:

        my.contrasts <- makeContrasts(
        c1 = (PRTYFP_POS-PRTYFP_NEG), # comparison: yfp pos / yfp neg
        c2 = (PRTALL_SORT-PRTNO_SORT),  # comparison all sort / no sort 
        c3 = (PRTALL_SORT-PRTYFP_POS), # comparison all sort / yfp pos
        ...
        ...
        ...
        c7 = (PRTYFP_POS-PRTYFP_NEG)-(PRTALL_SORT-PRTNO_SORT), levels=design # comparison 
        )
        interesting.contrasts <- c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4", "c5", "c6","c7")

        You can also ask the difference in genes between c1 and c2 (c7)  

##### what is a DEG?
##### What is the probability of a gene in a given condition whose expresiuon value is centered at 10 to be found within the distribution of the same gene in other condition
